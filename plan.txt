		Time for screeps!
		My room is pretty neat, two energy spots near each other and the controller
		LOTS of spawp though, gonna be expensive for roads
		First thing is to get a screep upgrading the controller. Gonna go for simple
	12:15am
		Alrighty, got my basic upgrader as well as a framework for creeps and utility code
		Gonna let it run for a bit, hopefully my room stays healthy and is level 2 when I come back
